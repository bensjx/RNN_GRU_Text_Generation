# RNN_GRU_Text_Generation
This repo creates a simple Recurrent Neural Network for text generation. The Dense layer was subsequently replaced with a GRU layer to compare the performance.

# Concepts:
1. Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenizing, padding)
2. Simple RNN
3. Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU layer)
4. Synthetic text generation
